### Projects

|**Title:**| **Music Time plugin for Sublime Text**|
|:-----|:----|
|**Technology** | Python, Sublime API|
|**Description**|Music Time is a plugin that discovers the most productive music to listen to as you code. It will recommend the songs using AI, and will provide control of Spotify player to the developer through the editor only.|
|**Contribution:**| Collecting keystrokes events, building UI for interacting with spotify API.|

|**Title:** |**House Price Prediction Dashboard** |
|:-----|:----|
|**Technology** | Python, Dash, Plotly, Heroku
|**Description**|Considering various features of house sale data, we build a predictive model using Gradient boosted regressor, which can estimate price of house.|
|**Contribution:**|Data Pre-processing, building model, creating web UI where users can provide input and considering them price will be predicted.|

|**Title:** | **FAQ Chatbot**|
|:-----|:----|
**Technology** | Python, Rasa Core , NLU, MongoDB, HTML|
||A chatbot that will handle FAQs. We used Rasa core and Rasa NLU which are open source python libraries for creating conversational software that helps in making machine-learning based dialogue management and natural language understanding systems.|
|**Contribution**| Sample data collection, creating intents, utterance, handling fallback,training data using tensorflow embedding.|

|**Title:** | **Face Recognition system** |
|:-----|:----|
**Technology|Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Tkinter**|
|**Description**|Facenet is mostly deployed with MTCNN (for face detection and alignment) which is computationally expensive, so instead we prefer to use Haar Cascade for face detection which saves a lot of excessive computation and avoids incorrect recognition of distant persons. Instead of looping through user data, creating embedding every time, we had serialized them which has reduced the recognition time significantly.|
|**Contribution:**| Data collection, deployment of the model for the office attendance system.|

<hr>


|**Title** |**Product Prices Prediction System(PG-DBDA)**|
|:-----|:----|
|**Technology** | Apache Hadoop, R programming, H2O, Tableau, Machine Learning|
|**Description**|Product pricing gets even harder to scale considering just how many products are sold online. To tackle this problem, doing EDA on transactional data, using ML techniques, taking price as a response variable, we predict the prices of various items across item categories considering other factors too. Helps sellers to scale right product prices.|
|**Contribution**| Data cleaning and normalisation, EDA using R, implementing ensemble model using H2O, visualizing the results|
